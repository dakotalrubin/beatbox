# beatbox
  
A new drum beat for your next hit song just popped into your head... You wait for your DAW to load and poof, the idea's all gone! With our new drum sequencer that can be played in a web browser, you can instantly make those beats in your head real.  
  
Users will be able to navigate the simple user interface intuitively, consisting of a grid of squares with the ability to light up upon being clicked (or "activated"). Each row in the grid will have a "default sound" button to the left, which can be clicked to allow users to upload their own audio files instead of the default kick drum, snare drum, hi hats, etc. Users can set the tempo at the top (default: 120 bpm), and hit the "play" button to play the sequence of squares they've selected in the grid. The drum pattern will then loop around to the start and play again until the user presses the "stop" button. The squares selected by the user will light up (like the sparkle on a disco ball!) while the drum pattern is being played.  
  
Good features to include are volume, panning (left or right channel), mute and solo buttons associated with each "default sound" button to the left of the grid to give the user some extra control. Optionally, we could allow the user to save the drum sequence they've created as a lossless or compressed audio file, but I'm trying not to be too ambitious here.  
  
This project can be implemented with just HTML, CSS and vanilla JS, but I'm open to fancier stuff upon request.
